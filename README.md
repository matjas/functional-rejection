# functional-rejection

Application example written using functional paradigm.

Inspired by [Eric Elliott](https://github.com/ericelliott) rejection game.

The game has **one** rule:
    You must be rejected by a human being at least once per day.

    Ask for things outside your comfort zone, and you'll find yourself winning a lot more.

    Win = 1 point | Rejection = 10 points.

    If you have wins and rejections on the same day, your win points are multiplied by 10.

    How long can you make your rejection streak last?

## How to run

1. install node packages: npm install
2. run application in development mode: npm start
