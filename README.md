# functional-rejection
Application example written using functional paradigm.
Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/ericelliott" target="_blank">Eric Elliott</a>
The game has one rule:
    You must be rejected by a human being at least once per day.
    Ask for things outside your comfort zone, and you'll find yourself winning a lot more.
    Win = 1 point | Rejection = 10 points.
    If you have wins and rejections on the same day, your win points are multiplied by 10.
    How long can you make your rejection streak last?
